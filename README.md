Hi there, I go here by the name of ReversalPM, I'm a high-school student interested in CS and IT. 
I am currently focused in Front-End Development - or more exactly JS - and as for Back-End I want to know SQL.
I'm on GitHub because I wanted to post projects I made when I need help to continue my development as a developer. 
I am really honored for you to understand this, and I look forward to my journey with you all on GitHub :)
